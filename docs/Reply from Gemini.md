To analyze the belt resonance data, I have processed the uploaded gemini_belt_analysis_prompt.md and the raw accelerometer logs for Belt A and Belt B.1. Analysis of Current ResonancesThe core issue is a discrepancy between the expected belt frequency (~110 Hz) and the peaks identified by the current algorithm (104–107 Hz).Belt A (raw_data_belt_a_latest.csv): The sweep starts at $331227.67s$. By examining the Y-axis (primary belt vibration axis) acceleration, we see high-amplitude oscillations throughout the sweep. The algorithm's tendency to pick 104–107 Hz suggests it is latching onto a structural resonance of the Voron 2.4 gantry rather than the belt itself.Belt B (raw_data_belt_b_latest.csv): The prompt notes that the 110 Hz signal is nearly missing (1.22% power). This often occurs when the belt is "shaded" by a stronger gantry resonance or if the toolhead position (Y=100) puts the belt at a node for that specific frequency.2. Proposed "Position-Sweep" Measurement ApproachThe current method (fixed position, sweeping frequency) is prone to gantry interference. A Y-position sweep at a fixed frequency is a robust alternative.Design Strategy:Drive Frequency: Select a "clean" frequency away from known gantry modes (e.g., 110 Hz or 120 Hz).Execution: Command the toolhead to move slowly from $Y=80$ to $Y=120$ while the shaper system vibrates the motors at that fixed frequency.Extraction: Instead of a frequency FFT, you perform a spatial resonance mapping. You plot Acceleration vs. Y-Position. The peak acceleration will occur at the exact Y-coordinate where the belt's natural frequency matches the drive frequency.Why this works: Structural resonances (the frame/gantry) are largely independent of the toolhead's Y-position. Belt resonances, however, are strictly tied to $L$ (segment length). By moving the toolhead, you "tune" the belt into the fixed drive frequency, allowing you to isolate the belt's contribution from the static structural response.3. Algorithm ImprovementsTo correctly identify 110 Hz in the existing data:Slope Tracking: Implement a filter that looks for peaks that shift in frequency as Y-position changes. Belt frequencies follow the $f \propto 1/L$ relationship; structural resonances do not.Harmonic Weighting: If the 110 Hz peak is weak, check for the second harmonic at 220 Hz. If a peak exists there, it confirms the fundamental is indeed 110 Hz, even if the fundamental is suppressed by a gantry anti-resonance.Power Normalization: Normalize the FFT against a "baseline" gantry response taken at a different Y-position to "subtract" the frame's influence.
